  abstract = "Nonlinear manifold learning algorithms, such as diffusion maps,
              have been fruitfully applied in recent years to the analysis of
              large and complex data sets. However, such algorithms still
              encounter challenges when faced with real data. One such
              challenge is the existence of ``repeated eigendirections,'' which
              obscures the detection of the true dimensionality of the
              underlying manifold and arises when several embedding coordinates
              parametrize the same direction in the intrinsic geometry of the
              data set. We propose an algorithm, based on local linear
              regression, to automatically detect coordinates corresponding to
              repeated eigendirections. We construct a more parsimonious
              embedding using only the eigenvectors corresponding to unique
              eigendirections, and we show that this reduced diffusion maps
              embedding induces a metric which is equivalent to the standard
              diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and
              flexibility of our approach on synthetic data sets. We then apply
              our algorithm to data collected from a stochastic model of
              cellular chemotaxis, where our approach for factoring out
              repeated eigendirections allows us to detect changes in dynamical
              behavior and the underlying intrinsic system dimensionality

              we introduce a hierarchy of representations which meet uniqueness
              and target similarity criteria. To systematically control target
              similarity, we simply rely on interatomic many body expansions,

              Angular (BA), and higher order terms. Addition of higher order

              models. We report numerical evidence for the performance of BAML

               for k labelled points in Rm was given by Kendall for the
               atypically simple situations in which m = 1 or 2 and k $\geq$ 2.
               Here we deal with the general case (m $\geq$ 1, k $\geq$ 2) by
               using the properties of Riemannian submersions and warped
               products as studied by O'Neill. The approach is via the
               associated size-and-shape space that is the warped product of
               the shape space and the half-line R+ (carrying size), the
               warping function being equal to the square of the size. When
               combined with parallel studies by Le of the corresponding global
