  abstract = "The hypothesis that high dimensional data tend to lie in the
              vicinity of a low dimensional manifold is the basis of manifold
              learning. The goal of this paper is to develop an algorithm (with
              accompanying complexity guarantees) for testing the existence of
              a manifold that fits a probability distribution supported in a
              separable Hilbert space, only using i.i.d. samples from that
              distribution. More precisely, our setting is the following.
              Suppose that data are drawn independently at random from a
              probability distribution supported on the unit ball of a
              separable Hilbert space . Let be the set of submanifolds of the
              unit ball of whose volume is at most and reach (which is the
              supremum of all such that any point at a distance less than has a
              unique nearest point on the manifold) is at least . Let denote
              the mean-squared distance of a random point from the probability

astronomical community as a new classification technique, using Sloan
Digital Sky Survey spectra as an example data set. LLE is a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that has been studied in the context of
computer perception. We compare the performance of LLE to well-known
spectral classification techniques, e.g., principal component analysis and
line-ratio diagnostics. We find that LLE combines the strengths of both
methods in a single, coherent technique, and leads to improved
classification of emission-line spectra at a relatively small
computational cost. We also present a data subsampling technique that
preserves local information content, and proves effective for creating
small, efficient training samples from large, high-dimensional data sets.
Software used in this LLE-based classification is made available.}

	Abstract = {<p>One of the most cited books in mathematics, John Milnor's exposition of Morse theory has been the most important book on the subject for more than forty years. Morse theory was developed in the 1920s by mathematician Marston Morse. (Morse was on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Princeton published his<em>Topological Methods in the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable</em>in the Annals of Mathematics Studies series in 1947.) One classical application of Morse theory includes the attempt to understand, with only limited information, the large-scale structure of an object. This kind of problem occurs in mathematical physics, dynamic systems, and mechanical engineering. Morse theory has received much attention in the last two decades as a result of a famous paper in which theoretical physicist Edward Witten relates Morse theory to quantum field theory.</p><p>Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal (the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel Prize) in 1962 for his work in differential topology. He has since received the National Medal of Science (1967) and the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society twice (1982 and 2004) in recognition of his explanations of mathematical concepts across a wide range of scienti.c disciplines. The citation reads, "The phrase sublime elegance is rarely associated with mathematical exposition, but it applies to all of Milnor's writings. Reading his books, one is struck with the ease with which the subject is unfolding and it only becomes apparent after re.ection that this ease is the mark of a master.?</p><p>Milnor has published five books with Princeton University Press.</p>},

@inproceedings{Backurs2018-cj,
	Abstract = {Given a kernel function k(.,.) and a dataset P$\subset$ R^d, the
               kernel density function of P at a point x$\in$ Rdis equal to
               KDFP(x):= 1/|P| $\Sigma$y$\in$P k(x, y). Kernel density
               evaluation has numerous applications, in scientific computing,
               statistics, computer vision, machine learning and other fields.
               In all of them it is necessary to evaluate KDFP(x)quickly, often
               for many inputs x and large point-sets P. In this paper we
               present a collection of algorithms for efficient KDF evaluation
               under the assumptions that the kernel k is ``smooth'', i.e. the
               value changes at most polynomially with the distance. This
               assumption is satisfied by several well-studied kernels,
               including the (generalized) t-student kernel and rational
               quadratic kernel. For smooth kernels, we give a data structure
               that, after O(dn log ($\Phi$ n)/$\epsilon$^2) preprocessing,
               estimates KDFP(x)up to a factor of 1 $\pm$ $\epsilon$ in O(dlog
               ($\Phi$ n)/$\epsilon$2) time, where Phi; is the aspect ratio.
               The log($\Phi$n) term can be further replaced by log n under an
               additional decay condition on k, which is satisfied by the
               aforementioned examples. We further extend the results in two
               ways. First, we use low-distortion embeddings to extend the
               results to kernels defined for spaces other than ?\_2. The key
               feature of this reduction is that the distortion of the
               embedding affects only the running time of the algorithm, not
               the accuracy of the estimation. As a result, we obtain
               (1+$\epsilon$)-approximate estimation algorithms for kernels
               over other ?pnorms, Earth-Mover Distance, and other metric
               spaces. Second, for smooth kernels that are decreasing with
               distance, we present a general reduction from density estimation
               to approximate near neighbor in the underlying space. This
               allows us to construct algorithms for general doubling metrics,
               as well as alternative algorithms for lpnorms and other spaces.},

@article{Constantine2014-qi,
	Abstract = {Many multivariate functions in engineering models vary primarily
               along a few directions in the space of input parameters. When
               these directions correspond to coordinate directions, one may
               apply global sensitivity measures to determine the most
               influential parameters. However, these methods perform poorly
               when the directions of variability are not aligned with the
               natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to
               first detect the directions of the strongest variability using
               evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these
               directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional
               subspace---i.e., the active subspace---of the inputs. We develop
               a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the
               theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response
               surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an
               elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100
               Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local
               sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

@inbook{Chen2013,
	Abstract = {Large data sets arise in a wide variety of applications and are often modeled as samples from a probability distribution in high-dimensional space. It is sometimes assumed that the support of such probability distribution is well approximated by a set of low intrinsic dimension, perhaps even a low-dimensional smooth manifold. Samples are often corrupted by high-dimensional noise. We are interested in developing tools for studying the geometry of such high-dimensional data sets. In particular, we present here a multiscale transform that maps high-dimensional data as above to a set of multiscale coefficients that are compressible/sparse under suitable assumptions on the data. We think of this as a geometric counterpart to multi-resolution analysis in wavelet theory: whereas wavelets map a signal (typically low dimensional, such as a one-dimensional time series or a two-dimensional image) to a set of multiscale coefficients, the geometric wavelets discussed here map points in a high-dimensional point cloud to a multiscale set of coefficients. The geometric multi-resolution analysis (GMRA) we construct depends on the support of the probability distribution, and in this sense it fits with the paradigm of dictionary learning or data-adaptive representations, albeit the type of representation we construct is in fact mildly nonlinear, as opposed to standard linear representations. Finally, we apply the transform to a set of synthetic and real-world data sets.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes InfoGAN, an information-theoretic
                   extension to the Generative Adversarial Network that is able
                   to learn disentangled representations in a completely
                   unsupervised manner. InfoGAN is a generative adversarial
                   network that also maximizes the mutual information between a
                   small subset of the latent variables and the observation. We
                   derive a lower bound to the mutual information objective
                   that can be optimized efficiently, and show that our
                   training procedure can be interpreted as a variation of the
                   Wake-Sleep algorithm. Specifically, InfoGAN successfully
                   disentangles writing styles from digit shapes on the MNIST
                   dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images, and
                   background digits from the central digit on the SVHN

                   styles, presence/absence of eyeglasses, and emotions on the
                   CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that InfoGAN learns
                   interpretable representations that are competitive with

	Abstract = {Modern single-cell technologies allow multiplexed sampling of
              cellular states within a tissue. However, computational tools
              that can infer developmental cell-state transitions reproducibly
              from such single-cell data are lacking. Here, we introduce
              p-Creode, an unsupervised algorithm that produces multi-branching
              graphs from single-cell data, compares graphs with differing
              topologies, and infers a statistically robust hierarchy of
              cell-state transitions that define developmental trajectories. We
              have applied p-Creode to mass cytometry, multiplex
              immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-seq data. As a test case,
              we validate cell-state-transition trajectories predicted by
              p-Creode for intestinal tuft cells, a rare, chemosensory cell
              type. We clarify that tuft cells are specified outside of the
              Atoh1-dependent secretory lineage in the small intestine.
              However, p-Creode also predicts, and we confirm, that tuft cells
              arise from an alternative, Atoh1-driven developmental program in
              the colon. These studies introduce p-Creode as a reliable method
              for analyzing large datasets that depict branching transition
              trajectories.},

@article{Luo2009-mp,
	Abstract = {The gradient of a function defined on a manifold is perhaps one
               of the most important differential objects in data analysis.
               Most often in practice, the input function is available only at
               discrete points sampled from the underlying manifold, and the
               manifold is approximated by either a mesh or simply a point
               cloud. While many methods exist for computing gradients of a
               function defined over a mesh, computing and simplifying
               gradients and related quantities such as critical points, of a
               function from a point cloud is non-trivial. In this paper, we
               initiate the investigation of computing gradients under a
               different metric on the manifold from the original natural
               metric induced from the ambient space. Specifically, we map the
               input manifold to the eigenspace spanned by its Laplacian
               eigenfunctions, and consider the so-called diffusion distance
               metric associated with it. We show the relation of gradient
               under this metric with that under the original metric. It turns
               out that once the Laplace operator is constructed, it is easier
               to approximate gradients in the eigenspace for discrete inputs
               (especially point clouds) and it is robust to noises in the
               input function and in the underlying manifold. More importantly,
               we can easily smooth the gradient field at different scales
               within this eigenspace framework. We demonstrate the use of our
               new eigen-gradients with two applications: approximating /
               simplifying the critical points of a function, and the Jacobi
               sets of two input functions (which describe the correlation
               between these two functions), from point clouds data.},

	Abstract = {We consider the $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate nearest neighbor search problem: given a set $X$ of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space, build a data structure that, given any query point  $y$,  finds a point $x \in X$ whose distance to $y$ is at most $(1+\epsilon) \min_{x \in X} \|x-y\|$ for an accuracy parameter $\epsilon \in (0,1)$.  Our main result is a data structure that occupies only $O(\epsilon^{-2} n \log(n) \log(1/\epsilon))$ bits of space, assuming all point coordinates are integers in the range  $\{-n^{O(1)} \ldots n^{O(1)}\}$, i.e., the coordinates have $O(\log n)$ bits of precision. This improves over the best previously known space bound of         $O(\epsilon^{-2} n \log(n)^2)$, obtained via the randomized dimensionality reduction method of Johnson and Lindenstrauss (1984).  We also consider the more general problem of estimating all distances from a collection of query points to all data points $X$, and provide almost tight upper and lower bounds for the space complexity of this problem. },

	Abstract = {We introduce locally linear embedding (LLE) to the astronomical community as a new classification technique, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra as an example data set. LLE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that has been studied in the context of computer perception. We compare the performance of LLE to well-known spectral classification techniques, e.g., principal component analysis and line-ratio diagnostics. We find that LLE combines the strengths of both methods in a single, coherent technique, and leads to improved classification of emission-line spectra at a relatively small computational cost. We also present a data subsampling technique that preserves local information content, and proves effective for creating small, efficient training samples from large, high-dimensional data sets. Software used in this LLE-based classification is made available.},
